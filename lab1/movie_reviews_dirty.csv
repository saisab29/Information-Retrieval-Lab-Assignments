review
"<br> I LOVED this movie!!! The plot was 10/10, so exciting & the characters were AMAZING!!! :D"
Terrible movie... Waste of $$ and time!! I won't recommend to ANYONE... http://badmovie.com
"An average film -- some good moments, but overall it was sooo predictable and boring :("
"Fantastic performance by the lead actor!!! Brilliant cinematography, though a bit too long..."
"Bad script, poor direction. 1234 Not worth watching at ALL <html>skip</html>."
"Mediocre at best... acting was weak, editing sloppy, and soundtrack forgettable."
WOW! What a masterpiece <3 This is the best film I've seen in years... flawless!
Didn't like it. Overhyped and underwhelming. Fell asleep halfway through.
"Strong start, but the ending completely ruined it... felt rushed and unfinished."
Loved the visuals!!! Storyline meh... would only watch again for the cinematography.
