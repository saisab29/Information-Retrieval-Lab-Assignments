# Information Retrieval Lab Assignments

This repository contains practical implementations of **Information Retrieval (IR)**, **Text Categorization**, **Clustering**, **Recommendation Systems**, and **Question Answering** techniques using Python. Each module demonstrates core concepts in IR and NLP with toy datasets for educational purposes.

## **Table of Contents**

- **Lab 1: Text Preprocessing & NLP Techniques in IR**

  - Tokenization, lowercasing, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization.
  - Prepares text for indexing, retrieval, and similarity computations.

- **Lab 2: Basic IR Models**

  - **Boolean Model**: AND, OR, NOT queries on documents.
  - **TF-IDF & Vector Space Model**: Compute cosine similarity between query and documents.
  - **KL Divergence**: Probabilistic similarity between query and documents.
  - _(Optional)_ Your own Vector Space or Probabilistic Models.

- **Lab 3: Evaluation of IR Systems**

  - Metrics: **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-Score**.
  - Evaluate the effectiveness of retrieval models using sample queries and relevance judgments.

- **Lab 4: Query Operations**

  - Query expansion using WordNet or thesaurus.
  - Spelling correction: Edit Distance, K-Gram Index, Context-sensitive correction.
  - Query languages: Single-word, Boolean, Natural Language, Structural Queries.

- **Lab 5: Text Categorization**

  - Supervised models: **Naive Bayes**, **Decision Tree**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**.
  - Rocchio algorithm for relevance feedback.

- **Lab 6: Text Clustering**

  - Unsupervised models: **K-Means**, **K-Medoids**.
  - Similarity measures: Cosine, Euclidean, and **Text Shingling** for near-duplicate detection.

- **Lab 7: Recommendation Systems**

  - **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommending items (books) based on textual similarity.
  - **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommending items (movies) based on user-user similarity.

- **Lab 8: Question Answering**
  - Similarity-based retrieval of top-k sentences.
  - Conditional aggregation to form answers.
  - Simple mini-RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline.
